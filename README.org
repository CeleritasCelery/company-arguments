* company arguments

This package is in the early stages of development, and there are surely edge cases that are not handled correctly. The current implementation is using =--help= and parsing the output. Here are some of limitation that are immediately apparent.

- doesn't handle "old style" arguments (e.g. =-name=, =-dir=, =-depth=, etc)
- doesn't support arguments bundling (i.e. transforming =-A=, =-B=, =-C=, into =-ABC=)
- stuggles with case insensitive matching



** improvement areas

- handle argument bundling
- provide default values for arguments that accept them (e.g. =--color=auto= =--color=never=)
- using caching to improve performace (the backend is asynchronous, so it will never block, but some commands can still take a while to respond)
- create a blacklist of commands that this backend can't handle (e.g. =git=, =find=, etc)
- handle command aliases
